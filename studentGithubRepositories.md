All students are required to create a Github account, if they don't have one,
and in that account, to create a repository for this class. Instructions for
doing this are
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources).

Please use your name for your account name so that I can more easily recognize
it, and name your repository "CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics". If you don't
want to use your name for privacy reasons, please choose an alias that I can
recognize as you.
