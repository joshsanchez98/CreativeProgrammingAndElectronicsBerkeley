COURSE DESCRIPTION

In this course, we will explore the creative and expressive nature of
computational approaches to art and design. We will approach writing code like
creative writing, to tell a story or to express our feelings. We will build
machines like creating artworks, to embrace failure and to adventure into the
unknown.

Over the course of the semester, you will learn how to write code and build
electronics for a series of art machine projects, including robotic
instruments, kinetic sculptures, and interactive installations. We will
be using the Arduino, an open-source library and integrated
development environment (IDE) built for makers—students, hobbyists, artists,
programmers, and professionals; and Processing, another
creative software, as a tool for augmenting the physical world with digital
information.

Along the way, we will also look at a variety of strange, whimsical, and
beautiful works created by historical and contemporary artists and
technologists, and we will re-think computation from a poetic, provocative
perspective.

PREREQUISITES

This course has no prerequisites. It pairs well with DES INV 22: Prototyping &
Fabrication I, but the two courses can be taken in either sequence, or
individually.

ATTENDANCE

This course contains a great deal of technical material and creative
information, and because our process of experimentation and critique is
collaborative, attendance is mandatory. You are allowed two absences for the
semester without penalty (except critique days and design showcase); – each
additional absence will result in zero credit for the missed session.  

To receive an additional excused absence, you must ask in advance, and receive
an acknowledgment from the instructor. Excusable absences include family
emergencies, job interviews, vastly different time zones, presenting at a
conference, and poor internet connectivity.

To receive credit
for attendance, you must arrive on time. No late assignments will be accepted.
For any absence, it is the student’s responsibility to inquire with classmates
for notes, make up any exercises completed in class, and to complete impending
assignments.


ZOOM

This course will be delivered online using Zoom. 

* Lectures will be recorded for students unable to attend live lectures
* These recordings are only viewable by class members
* Students can watch these recordings later as reference material, 
but may not extract pieces of them for any purpose
* These recordings will be deleted on **TBA**

During meetings, I expect your cameras to be turned on.
Your facial expressions are important feedback for me to know whether
you are understanding the material. Furthermore, sharing our
faces is a sign of mutual respect.
If there are extenuating circumstances that prevent you from 
turning on your camera, you must state your reason to me in an email 
in advance, and receive an acknowledgment from me.

Students who leave their cameras off without permission
will be marked as absent.


PARTICIPATION

Please speak up in class! It's especially important on Zoom. Since I can't
see your faces, I don't know if what I'm saying makes sense. Ask questions,
make comments, give me feedback, make jokes. Remember that your
participation is being graded!

SUMMER SHOWCASE 

Apart from our regular class meetings, participation in the 
virtual showcase on Friday, August 14th 10-4pm
is required. Our class will have an hour 
during which each student will present their project. Attendance is mandatory.

ASSISTANCE

If you are not familiar with this material, you might find it
frustrating at first. Finding problems in programs and electronics circuits
is like trying to solve a detective mystery by following clues, 
but the program or circuit will give you clues only when you ask
very simple questions to which you will get very literal answers. 
Computers and electronics only understand what you tell them, 
not what you mean. But don't feel bad, we all started the same way.
Even professional programmers spend more time trying to fix their 
own problems than writing the programs in the first place.
The only reason I'm good at finding your problems is that I've 
made them all myself, many times.

Fortunately, there are many ways to get help:

1. We have set up a [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/des-inv-23summer2020/shared_invite/zt-frlwrm41-IbyM0vdumrIgBSwLNNYdWA)
	for this class. Please join.
This should be the first place to ask a question 
because one of your fellow students may have an answer before the
professor or GSI responds
1. We are fortunate to have a GSI who will have scheduled office hours (TBA)
and will also be available via email.
1. Jacobs Hall Design Specialist [office hours](https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/our-space/design-specialists/)
1. Your professor welcomes questions by email at any time, although
answers may not be immediate depending on the time.
1.  At least two of the Jacobs Hall Design Fellows
(Eric Weinhoffer and Zahin Ali) are holding office hours over the
summer). The website doesn't reflect this yet, but will be udpated on Monday
and the details will be added here.

RESPONSIBILITY

This program is very generous in the multitude of assistance available,
but it is your responsibility to seek this assistance if you need help. If you
are traditionally shy about asking for help, consider this an opportunity to
develop this very important skill. This skill is important not only for this
course, but for your entire future.

DISTRACTIONS

Using a cellphone or laptop in class for purposes other than classwork is not
tolerated. If you are caught 3 times doing so your grade for the course will
be an F, regardless of your work.

HOMEWORK

Homework in this class is meant to be exploratory, a way to expand on the
experiences and ideas in class. I encourage wide-ranging interpretation of
assignments: consider ways that you can complete the project that are
creatively and intellectually exciting for you. Don't limit yourself to
fulfilling the basic requirements. (That said, some assignments will have
restrictions on them – these kinds of constraints can spur creativity, so
embrace them!)

You should expect the material to be rigorous and thorough. Unlike tests,
projects require considerable engagement and thoughtful work on your own, and
I want to see you working each week on projects. All assignments are due by
the start of class and should be turned in on your Github repository, which
will be explained and created on the first day of class.
Details of each
project will be available on the class page 
including details about how to turn in specific projects,
what’s to be included, etc.

REQUIRED MATERIALS

Before class starts, prepare **all** of these materials:

- Electronics kit
- Laptop on which you have permission to install software
- Laptop charger 
- A notebook or sketchbook for taking notes and drawing ideas, even if you
	take notes on your laptop
- A clear, well-lit space to work

Required and suggested readings will be provided as PDFs on the course site –
there is no required textbook.

GRADING

The goal of all assignments is for you to think and make. Everyone comes from
a different background and experience, so I’ll be looking for improvement,
curiosity, engagement, and a willingness to experiment. A grading rubric will
be provided with each assignment to help you understand what is expected and
how you did.

To get a C (an average grade) you should:
- Put time into your projects each week
- Complete everything on time
- Participate in critiques and discussions

For a B or an A, you should additionally:
- Take risks and try things enthusiastically
- Be an active and unsolicited participant in critiques and discussions
- Take assignments beyond their minimum requirements

Final grades will be determined as follows:
Class participation: 20%
Homework: 30%
Midterm project: 20%
Final project: 30%

**Inclusion**

We are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students
that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and
respects your identities and backgrounds (including race/ethnicity,
nationality, gender, class, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion,
ability, etc.) To help accomplish this: 

- If you have a name and/or set of
pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records, please
let me know, either in class or privately
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being
impacted by your experiences inside *or outside* of class 
(e.g., family matters, current
events), please don’t hesitate to reach out to me or your GSI 
or someone else from the Jacobs staff.
We want to be resources for you.  
- We (like many people) are still in the process of
learning about diverse perspectives and identities. 
If something was said in class **by anyone** that made you feel uncomfortable, 
please talk to one of us about it. 
You may also contact the engineering department’s 
Faculty Equity Advisor Prof. (**TBA**) (email).  
- As a participant in this class, please strive to respect the
diversity of your classmates.  

ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

All students are welcome here, regardless of race, orientation, disabilities,
and many other differences.
Students with disabilities who have a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) 
should contact me immediately to discuss their
disability-related academic needs. 

Disabled students who do not yet have an LOA must contact 
the Disabled Students' Program (DSP) at
510-642-0518 or [http://dsp.berkeley.edu](http://dsp.berkeley.edu) 
to request an appropriate LOA addressed to me. I am not permitted to 
make any accommodations without this LOA.

The Disabled Students' Program (DSP) is a campus department that works to
ensure that all students with disabilities have equal access to educational
opportunities at UC Berkeley. 

OTHER ACCOMMODATIONS

If you need religious or other accommodations in this class, 
or if you have emergency medical information you wish to share with us, 
please  let one of us know.

COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES

The main University Health Services Counseling and Psychological Services
staff is located at the Tang Center (http://uhs.berkeley.edu; 2222 Bancroft
Way; 642-9494) and provides confidential assistance to students managing
problems that can emerge from illness, financial, academic, legal,
family concerns, and more.

The Care Line (PATH to Care Center)

The Care Line (510-643-2005; https://care.berkeley.edu/care-line/) is a 24/7,
confidential, free, campus-based resource for urgent support around sexual
assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, 
stalking, and invasion of sexual privacy. 
The Care Line will connect you with a confidential advocate for
trauma-informed crisis support including time-sensitive information, 
securing urgent safety resources, 
and accompaniment to medical care or reporting.

OMBUDSPERSON FOR STUDENTS

The Ombudsperson for Students (102 Sproul Hall; 642-5754;
http://students.berkeley.edu/Ombuds) provides a confidential service for
students involved in a University-related problem (academic or
administrative), acting as a neutral complaint resolver and not as an advocate
for any of the parties involved in a dispute. The Ombudsman can provide
information on policies and procedures affecting students, facilitate
students' contact with services able to assist in resolving the problem, and
assist students in complaints concerning improper application of University
policies or procedures. All matters referred to this office are held in strict
confidence. The only exceptions, at the sole discretion of the Ombudsman, are
cases where there appears to be imminent threat of serious harm.

CONDUCT

Berkeley honor code

Everyone in this class is
expected to adhere to this code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I
act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” 

Academic honesty

You are encouraged to form study groups and work together to
understand course material, but all written work as well as responses to
in-class questions should be your own, unless the work is assigned as a group 
project. You may not copy other students’ work.

Academic integrity and ethical conduct are of utmost importance in the College
of Engineering and at U.C. Berkeley.  

LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 

We recognize that in 1868, UC Berkeley was established on Huichin Ohlone land.

COURSE CALENDAR

assigned, with the due date indicated

Lecture notes are in [this](lectureNotes.md) file.

#### Meeting 1: July 6

Lecture 
- Start download of Arduino and Processing
- Introduce course and people (teacher, GSI, students)

Activity
- Github
- Install and test Arduino (as soon as everyone has the kits)
- Introduction to Processing 
	- Primitive shapes
	- Programming concepts
	- Variables
	- Built-in variables (width, height)
	- Static vs. active mode

Homework (due July 8)

Email Assignment:

- Email me a link to your Github repository. Remember the difference
between a repository and an account.

Preparation Assignment, if you have have received your kit:

- If you had problems uploading the sketch,
use one of the assistants methods to resolve this
- Carefully cut the cable tie that holds the bundle of jumper wires together.
Be very careful not to cut the wires
or yourself.

Reading Assignment:

- Read [Getting Started with
	Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted)
- Read [Coordinate systems and
	space](https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing)

Production Assignment:

- Using what we've learned in Processing, create a simple 
	self portrait of yourself in an environment that is meaningful to you.
	The purpose of this exercise is to practice what we've learned, and
	not to test your artistic skills, so it doesn't really matter how
	good it is.
	- The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
	- The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it) 
	- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice
	using the simple drawing functions, and for us to get to know each other
	a little bit better.
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named ````July 8````
	- Upload your program into the new folder, with the extension ````.pde````. 
	Your
program should be well commented and organized. If you use any variables,
chose good names.
	- Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
	- Create a ````README.md```` 
	in the new folder and include your screenshot in 
	the ````README.md````.
	- Describe what the environment is supposed to be and 
	why it is important to you
	- Write a short description of any difficulties you had or anything
interesting you discovered.
