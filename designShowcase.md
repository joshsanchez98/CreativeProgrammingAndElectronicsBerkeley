[Joshua Rafael Sanchez](https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/tree/master/finalProjectSummer2020/README.md): Sound Experience (sound.exp) dissembles the aspects of a song and transforms them into components of art. Using the tools of Processing coding and Arduino robotics, the project allows the participant to change what they see in front of them with only a click or a slight movement of a part. Use this program with any MP3 file, and see your music come to life! | <img src="https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/blob/master/finalProjectSummer2020/screen4.png" width="1200" >

[Zarah Taufique](https://github.com/ztaufique/CreativeProgrammingandElectronics/blob/master/finalProjectSummer2020/README.md): In the United States, showering and bathing are the most significant indoor uses of water domestically at a whopping 27%. Access to water is often taken granted, and the Earth's supply of water is rapidly dwindling. Knowing this and from observing my family's water habits, I decided to create a Smart Shower that tracks the amount of time you have to take a shower. | <img src="https://github.com/ztaufique/CreativeProgrammingandElectronics/blob/master/finalProjectSummer2020/smartShowerProduct1.PNG" width="1200" >
Megan Ju: Have you ever wanted to create something in collaboration with an autonomous robot? This project allows you to control the look and feel of the overall art piece while working with the always roaming robot! Flip the switch, change the lighting, turn the potentiometer or knob, or yell near the computer's microphone to change anything about the piece. Make sure to save it and show all your friends!

Divyanshu Bhadoria: My project is a game where you control the growth of a tree. Your goal is to catch as many birds as you can before you reach the top using your two controls, a potentiometer and photoresister. The potentiometer control your angle of growth, while the photoresistor controls your speed.

Norman Chao: My final project is a game/interactive experience called "Sunset Cruise". It's a relaxing, late night driving experience, where you drive a car on an empty stretch of the highway to chill, lo-fi hip hop music. During the drive, you can choose between 7 different songs from the radio and you can cycle between them as you wish. All of the art is drawn with code in Processing (except for the title screen logo, the play button, and the car) and you control the car and the radio using Arduino input.

Josh Mao: Chromesthesia or sound-to-color synesthesia is a type of synesthesia in which sound involuntarily evokes an experience of color, shape, and movement. And while many piano players have hints of this condition, including me, we rarely can fully flesh out the grand multitude of colors that a piano piece creates when we are playing it. I wanted to undertake this project to create a fully functional, piano visualizer that utilizes LEDs to create an artificial "chromesthesia"; by hooking up microphone input to processing and my arduino to a strip of LEDs, I was able to design and engineer an interactive auditory and visual experience that can be enjoyed by professional piano players to beginners who have never touched an instrument before.
